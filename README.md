# Description: 
A Gomoku Omok Game for SENG 513, where 
  each player must aim to align 5 of their pieces 
  either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
  The player to first achieve this wins the game!

- Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, 
NodeJS, express, and socket.io.  

- Program uses white and black pieces statically, 
lets the player choose between 3 color themes and 
to enter a new username, stores themes and username
in cookies.

- Note: Small bug where first row buttons are hard to click
and unpressable on corners. I have no idea how to fix it. 
Random join may also be buggy but tested and should work. 

Instructions: 
- Download the necessary packages with npm install:
must install socket.io and express to run.

- cd into gomoku directory, and run node server.js to start the server side  

- go to http://localhost:3000/ in web browser to access app,
open another browser and repeat the steps to play with another user.

- Tested with 2 concurrent users using Google Chrome and Firefox.
